What makes a player an MVP?





I asked various colleagues, casual fans, coaches, and former players the question "What makes an NBA player an MVP from a statistical standpoint." 
The responses contained: 
* "+/- , defensive net rating, team success, their team needs to be top 5-10, or they need to do something absolutely historic"

* A high school basketball coach said "Obviously the standard Points, rebounds, and assists are important. I'd say most important is how efficient you are at a high volume. 
Anyone can shoot 3/4 and look efficient, but effeciency when shooting at a volume of say 15+ shots is what sets greats apart. Also +/- is big, but sometimes can be misleading, the box score doesn't always tell the whole story!"

* A former college player said, "Personally I say their impact while on the floor. Stats are difficult because they don't necessarily tell the teams/players play styles. The important stats to me are +/- , efficiency, total shot % are important."
