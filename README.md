## What makes a player an MVP?





####  I asked various colleagues, casual fans, coaches, and former players the question "What makes an NBA player an MVP from a statistical standpoint." 
The responses contained: 
* "+/- , defensive net rating, team success, their team needs to be top 5-10, or they need to do something absolutely historic"

* A high school basketball coach said "Obviously the standard Points, rebounds, and assists are important. I'd say most important is how efficient you are at a high volume. 
Anyone can shoot 3/4 and look efficient, but effeciency when shooting at a volume of say 15+ shots is what sets greats apart. Also +/- is big, but sometimes can be misleading, the box score doesn't always tell the whole story!"

* A former college player said, "Personally I say their impact while on the floor. Stats are difficult because they don't necessarily tell the teams/players play styles. The important stats to me are +/- , efficiency, total shot % are important."


* Stats are measurements, 

Think about 
1. What are we measuring?

2. How does it impact winning?

* Stats require context
1. How can teammates impact stats
2. How do team/league tactics & strategies impact the measurements?

* What question are we asking, and what might be missing?
  1. "shooting skill" is not the same as field goal percentage
  2. Player value is not equal to per game pts/reb/ast


Some key statistics I will be exploring (with pros and cons) :

Points / Rebounds / Assists: 

The standard big 3 stats, we all see them on a regular basis, and are the foundation of many additional stats. 

Pros:

Cons:
Doesn't tell us much about defense, (other than rebounds) 
Doesn't address quality of scoring / where they come from 
Assists don't tell us quality of passes
Doesnt' tell us about the rest of the offense player works with

## Field Goal %: 

Doesn't measure shooting ability, doesn't take into consideration quality of shots

Traditional metric for shooting

Pros:

Cons:

Overall makes picture cloudy by blending 3pt and 2pt shots together, while not averaging free throws. 

Lower % doesn't necessarily mean inefficiency

Doesn't factor where players take their shots from , 33% from 3pt is the same as 50% from 2. 



## Points per shot:

Ex, player scores 20 points off of 14 "effective attempts"- Free throws attempted + 3pt Attempted + 2pt Attempted. They scored 1.43/ shot. 

True Shooting %: 

This means they would need to shoot 71% from 2 point to match this efficiency. 




## Scoring Volume vs Efficiency: 

Some player's efficiency will go down at a higher volume than others

Tends to be a downward slope, the higher the volume, the lower the efficiency. 





## PIE Rating- Contribution to a game, perentage that single player contributed to a game.
22.4% would mean player produces 22.4%

## PER Rating- Player efficiency rating, measures against players on their own team
League average is 15.0
Jokic had 32.5 highest of all time. 
* 30-35 Runaway MVP 
* 20-25 - All star
* 15-20- Role player
* 10-15- Bench player

## Usage Rate: 

Usage rate is a stat that hels show how much a team leans on a player to create offense. 

How many of possessions ended in said player's hands

Percentage of possesions ending in a shot, turnover, or free throw. 

USG%=100× 
Minutes×(TeamFGA+0.44×TeamFTA+TeamTOV)
(FGA+0.44×FTA+TOV)×(TeamMinutes)

* It estimates the percentage of team plays that ended with that player shooting, getting fouled (and taking free throws), or turning it over while they were on the court.

* So if a guy has a 30% usage rate, roughly 30% of his team’s offensive possessions while he's on the floor end with him making a "usage action" (shot, FT, TO).
​

Pros:

* Great for understanding a player’s role—stars usually have high usage rates.

Contextualizes Volume

* Helps explain why some players have high raw stats—they're just getting more touches.

Identifying Playmakers

* Useful to separate role players from primary ball-handlers/scorers.

Highlights System Fit

* Tells you how a player might function in a different system—low-usage scorers might thrive in higher-usage roles, and vice versa.

Cons:



## Net Rating: 

Per 100 possessions how many points your team scores while player is on the floor, subtracted by the amount of points the other team scores while player is in the game. 

This can be skewed by having a really good team around said player 

For example, Isaiah Joe had a 16.0 last year, because he was on the 2nd team lineup for OKC, playing against other backups

Pros:

Cons:


## True shooting %: 

Calculates how good you are at field goals, free throws, and 3 pointers, averages out all shots based on how many points they are worth. 

Attempts to convert all shot types into 2pt %

True shot estimation tends to be extremely accurate to actual TS%

Pros:

True shooting % is the best way of quantifying scoring efficiency, because it shows points per scoring attempt, factoring 2s, 3s, and FTs.

Cons:


## Effective Field Goal %: 

Same concept as True Shooting %, but without free throws. 
eFG%: Takes into account points based on 
"2pt % based on points" 


Pros:

Cons:


## Per 36: 

Extrapolates stats as if they played 36 minutes per game

Pros:

Cons:


## Offensive Rating: 

How many points your team scores with player on the court per 100 possessions. 

Depends on pace of play usually

Pros:

Cons:


## Defensive Rating: 

How many points the opposing team scores with player on the court per 100 possesions. 

Pros:

Cons:
