## What makes a player an MVP?





####  I asked various colleagues, casual fans, coaches, and former players the question "What makes an NBA player an MVP from a statistical standpoint." 
The responses contained: 
* "+/- , defensive net rating, team success, their team needs to be top 5-10, or they need to do something absolutely historic"

* A high school basketball coach said "Obviously the standard Points, rebounds, and assists are important. I'd say most important is how efficient you are at a high volume. 
Anyone can shoot 3/4 and look efficient, but effeciency when shooting at a volume of say 15+ shots is what sets greats apart. Also +/- is big, but sometimes can be misleading, the box score doesn't always tell the whole story!"

* A former college player said, "Personally I say their impact while on the floor. Stats are difficult because they don't necessarily tell the teams/players play styles. The important stats to me are +/- , efficiency, total shot % are important."





Some key statistics I will be exploring:

PIE Rating- Contribution to a game, perentage that single player contributed to a game.
22.4% would mean player produces 22.4%

PER Rating- Player efficiency rating, measures against players on their own team
League average is 15.0
Jokic had 32.5 highest of all time. 
* 30-35 Runaway MVP 
* 20-25 - All star
* 15-20- Role player
* 10-15- Bench player

## Usage Rate:

Percentage of possesions ending in a shot, turnover, or free throw. 

Pros:

Cons:


## Net Rating: 

Per 100 possessions how many points your team scores while player is on the floor, subtracted by the amount of points the other team scores while player is in the game. 

This can be skewed by having a really good team around said player 

For example, Isaiah Joe had a 16.0 last year, because he was on the 2nd team lineup for OKC, playing against other backups

## True shooting %: 

Calculates how good you are at field goals, free throws, and 3 pointers, averages out all shots based on how many points they are worth.

Same concept as True Shooting %, but without free throws. 

Pros:

## Per 36: 

Extrapolates stats as if they played 36 minutes per game
